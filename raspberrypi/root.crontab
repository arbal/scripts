# obviously cloudflare dns :)

# IFTTT creds for use. set this to your key and make sure you have
# an event defined 'pizero' which is what will be used by the script
#IFTTT_KEY=abcde

# Power on script i.e. when tesla wakes up the hub is powered so our PI 
# should be booting.
#
# Note: need to send to background to let PI continue to boot

# if it takes longer, the cron interval should be adjusted but it is protected from
# mulitple invocation anyways.
#
# Purpose: Can be used to do general purpose stuff like check wifi/connectivity
# or send message via IFTTT etc.
