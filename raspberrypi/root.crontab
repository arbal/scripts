# setup a env variable for your home public IP which is used to 
# detect if PI is home. Make sure you set this correctly as this is
# obviously cloudflare dns :)
#HOME_PUBLIC_IP=1.1.1.1

# IFTTT creds for use. set this to your key and make sure you have
# an event defined 'pizero' which is what will be used by the script
#IFTTT_KEY=abcde

# punch SSH port on firewall for our external IPs to ssh into PI
# setup a port you want to ensure for ssh access, setup something other than 22
# but don't forget to change /etc/ssh/sshd_config to enable that port on pi
#EXTERNAL_SSH_PORT=22

# setup list of exteral IPs you want firewal to allow so you can ssh into PI
# note: this assumes you had configured firewall on PI (ufw is assumed)

# Power on script i.e. when tesla wakes up the hub is powered so our PI 
# should be booting.

# Note: need to send to background to let PI continue to boot
