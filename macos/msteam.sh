# msteam.sh --- wrapper to avoid ms-team behave like a pig draining power and cpu
#
# In addition to disabling gpu usage, restrict msteam to not to compete with other 
# apps for cpu by lowering priority to the absolute minimum. In addition, if available, 
# this script will use 'cpulimit' tool to lock it down CPU usage 
# 
# Optional: You can install the 'cpulimit' with Homebrew i.e. brew install cpulimit 
#
# Note: Most modern macs have 4 cores so the 50% (default value) will be limiting 
#       your msteam to use only 50% out of 400%, however msteam fork/exec's 4 child
#       process so each can get upto 50% CPU! so you can't win w/ this cpu pig! 
#       So the bottomline, it can potentially go up to 200% at the worst case but it 
#       doesnt seem to be going more than 100% which is good. If you reduce to 10%, 
#       it simply crawls hence the default of 50%
